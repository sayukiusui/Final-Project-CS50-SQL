Final Project CS50's Introduction to Databases with SQL 

This document contains all the necessary files and code I needed to pass the course. 
The database I worked with listed the makes, models, and technical specifications of all cars sold from 1984 onwards. 
Therefore, my objective with the database was to revise it and augment it with necessary tables, views, and indexes to make 
any querying done by the end-user faster and more efficient.
